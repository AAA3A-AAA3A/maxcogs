**What does no lience means?**
TD;LR
- you are not allowed to use that sourcecode without permissions granted from orginial owners.

**Actuall meaning**
If you find software that doesn’t have a license, that generally means you have no permission from the creators of the software to use, modify, or share the software. Although a code host such as GitHub may allow you to view and fork the code, this does not imply that you are permitted to use, modify, or share the software for any purpose.

**Your options**:

    - **Ask the maintainers nicely to add a license**. Unless the software includes strong indications to the contrary, lack of a license is probably an oversight.

    - **Don’t use the software**. Find or create an alternative that is under an open source license.

    - **Negotiate a private license**. Bring your lawyer.
