## PR is always welcome at anytime.

feel free to do bug fixes or things you wanna improve, i am always up to more than just fixes.

## When you do PR's you need to remember two things:
always use following:
- black
- isort

I will explain it simple and not a wall of text on how to install and use to make it easy, for question please ask me on discord MAX#1000.

## How to use black?

it's simple first you need to install black:
- `pip install black`

When that is done you run:

- `black {source_file_or_directory}`

## How to use isort?

it's as simple as black but this is with isort and you need to install this too:
- `pip install isort`

when that is done you run:

- `isort {source_file_or_directory}`

Version `21.7b0`of black and `5.9.3` of isort is what this repo is using.
