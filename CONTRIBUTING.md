## When you do PR's you need to remember two things:
always use following:

I will explain it simple and not a wall of text on how to install and use to make it easy, for question please ask me on discord MAX#1000.

## How to use black?

it's simple first you need to install black:
- `pip install black`

When that is done you run:

- `black {source_file_or_directory}`


Version `21.9b0` of black is what this repo is using.
