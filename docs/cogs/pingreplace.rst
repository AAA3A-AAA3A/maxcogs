``[p] is your prefix.``

.. note ::

        Once you load this cog, it will replace the uptime in core with this one, on unload you will have the core one back.

----
Usage
----
This cog only shows the bot ping and does not really do anything special other than that. This cog shows the pokemon names instead of ``ping pong`` with the bot's latency since i do believe alot people do not care about ``ping pong`` so i made it with pokemon names. This has the full list of pokemons from the national dex.

----
Commands
